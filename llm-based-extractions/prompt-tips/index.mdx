To extract from documents, describe your target data using Sensible's prompt-authoring environment, _Sensible Instruct_. Sensible Instruct is a large language model (LLM)-based subset of _SenseML_, Sensible's JSON-based document extraction query language. By combining Sensible Instruct and SenseML, you can extract data from a range of document types, from highly structured business forms to unstructured research documents.

See the following topics for tips on configuring extractions in Sensible Instruct:
