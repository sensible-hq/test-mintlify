    "type": "string",

Lead exposure is especially harmful to young children and pregnant women. Before renting a home built before 1978, landlords must disclose the presence of any known lead- based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards in the dwelling. Tenants must also receive a federally approved pamphlet on lead poisoning prevention."

## Notes

This method uses document layout to detect paragraphs. In contrast, the Document Range method extracts all the text between an upper and a lower bound.
