Extract free text from unstructured documents using large language model (LLM)-based SenseML methods. For example, extract information from legal paragraphs in contracts and leases, or results from research papers.

These methods are low-code alternatives to [layout-based methods](/senseml-reference/methods/overview) for structured documents, for example, tax documents or insurance forms. 

The following topics describe how to author LLM-based methods using the SenseML editor. For information about authoring LLM-based methods using a visual tool instead of JSON, see [Prompt tips](/llm-based-extractions/prompt-tips/overview). 

| Method                                               | Example use case                                                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                         |

| [List](/senseml-reference/llm-based-methods/list) method                            | "For each vehicle in an auto insurance declaration, extract the VIN, model, and year." | Extracts a list of data out of a document, where you don't know how the data are represented.                                                                 |
| [NLP Table](/senseml-reference/llm-based-methods/nlp-table) method                  | "For each transaction in a bank statement table, extract the date and amount."         | Extracts a list of data out of a document, where you know they're in a table.                                                                                 |
| [Query Group](/senseml-reference/llm-based-methods/query-group) method              | "When does the policy period end?""What are the last 4 numbers of the account?"        | Extracts a single fact or data point.                                                                                                                         |
| [Summarizer](/senseml-reference/llm-based-methods/summarizer) computed field method | transform extracted data using LLM prompts                                             | Use this method to transform another method's output when you can't use [types](/senseml-reference/field-query-object/types) or other [computed field methods](/senseml-reference/computed-field-methods/overview). |
