### Overview

Welcome! Sensible is a developer-first platform for extracting structured data from documents, for example, business forms in PDF format. It's highly configurable: you can get simple data in minutes by leveraging GPT-4 and other large-language models (LLMs), or you can tackle complex and idiosyncratic document formatting with Sensible's powerful layout-based document primitives.

See the following list for an overview of going live with Sensible:

* **Learn** to extract data, or use out-of-the-box supported document types
* [**Integrate**](/welcome/integrate) using Sensible's API, quick-extract UI, or other tools
* [**Quality control**](/best-practices/validate-extractions) extracted data
* [**Monitor**](/best-practices/metrics) extracted data in production

This guide gets you started with the first step, extracting data.

### Learn to extract data

Let's get started with extracting document data from an example bank statement. We'll use a large-language model (LLM) prompt to extract a checking account number in minutes.

 In this guide, you'll:

* Extract data from an example document using a natural-language description of your target data
* Publish your prompt as part of a "config."
* Test your config against a second, similar document to ensure it extracts the same target data.

### Get an account

1. Get an account at [sensible.so](https://app.sensible.so/register). If you don't have an account, you can still read along to get a rough idea of how things work.
2. Log into the [Sensible app](https://app.sensible.so/signin/).

### View an example

1. To view an example bank statement extraction, navigate to [https://app.sensible.so/editor/instruct/?d=sensible\_instruct\_basics&c=bank\_statement&g=bank\_statement](https://app.sensible.so/editor/instruct/?d=sensible%5Finstruct%5Fbasics&c=bank%5Fstatement&g=bank%5Fstatement).  
Sensible displays an example document in the left pane, and fields of extracted data in the right pane.

Take the following steps to create a prompt to extract more data from the document.

### Auto-extract data
To extract document data automatically, take the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Query group:">
   ![Click to enlarge](/images/quickstart_instruct_2.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the query group as shown in the following screenshot by entering checking account number (not savings) in the query field. Click Extract.">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sensible displays the extracted account number, 8347-32348, in the Extracted data section:">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Back to fields.">

  </Step>
</Steps>


### Manually configure extraction
1. To author your own LLM prompts to extract data points from the document, click Query group.
![](/images/manually-configure1.png)

2. Edit the query group as shown in the following screenshot by entering `checking account number (not savings)` in the query field. **Click Extract**.

3. Sensible displays the extracted account number, `8347-32348`, in the Extracted data section:

![](/images/manually-configure2.png)

4. Click **Back to fields**.

<Check>Congratulations! You extracted the checking account number from the bank statement.</Check>

### Publish the prompt

To extract checking account numbers from other bank statements, you'll need to publish the "config" containing your prompt.

 Click **Publish configuration**, click **Production**, then click **Publish to production**:

### Test the prompt

Let's see if the config containing your prompt works with other bank statements. To test the prompt, take the following steps:

1. Navigate to [https://app.sensible.so/editor/instruct/?d=sensible\_instruct\_basics&c=bank\_statement&g=bank\_statement\_2](https://app.sensible.so/editor/instruct/?d=sensible%5Finstruct%5Fbasics&c=bank%5Fstatement&g=bank%5Fstatement%5F2). Notice that the left pane now displays a statement for a different customer.

![Click to enlarge](/images/quickstart_instruct_8.png)

2. In the right pane, scroll down to the `account_num_checking` field you authored in previous steps. Verify that the extracted information automatically updated to reflect the second example document. For example, the account number updated from `8347-32348` to `9876-12345`:

It looks like your prompt was successful at extracting the checking account number from another document. Great! 

### (Optional) Extract more data

Try extracting more complex pieces of information. For example, try extracting the time period for each account using the [List method](llm-based-extractions/prompt-tips/list-tips). See the `accounts_list` field in this config for an example of using the List method.

Publish the config to save your changes.


### (Optional) Extract from your own documents

Sensible recommends grouping similar documents, for example, bank statments, into a document type. To extract data from your documents, first check if they're on Sensible's list of out-of-the-box [supported document types](/layout-based-extractions/library-quickstart). If not, configure your custom extractions by using the interactive [tutorial](https://app.sensible.so/tutorial/) or taking the following steps:

1. To exit the Sensible Instruct editor, click **Sensible** in the upper left corner.
2. Click the **Document types** tab. Create a new document type, then click the type you created to edit it.
3. In the document type's **Reference documents** tab, upload your own example document.
4. In the document type's **Configurations** tab, create a new test configuration, and click the configuration you created to edit it.
5. Write prompts in the configuration editor to extract data using what you learned in previous steps.
