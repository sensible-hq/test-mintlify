Use this tutorial if you want a guided tour of SenseML concepts and the Sensible app. Or see the following links:

* SenseML is for advanced config authoring. For a simpler authoring experience, use Sensible Instruct. For more information about SenseML versus Sensible Instruct, see [Choosing extraction strategy](/docs/author). For authoring in Sensible Instruct, see [Getting started](/docs/getting-started-ai).
* If you instead want to explore without much explanation, then [sign up](https://app.sensible.so/register) for an account and check out our interactive in-app tutorials in the `sensible_instruct_basics` document type.
* If you want a quick "hello world" API response, see the [API quickstart](/docs/quickstart).
