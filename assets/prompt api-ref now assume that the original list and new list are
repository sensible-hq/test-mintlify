now assume that the original list and new list are the same API endpoitns, but some were renamed in the new list. for each item in the original list and going in order, show how the origional item was renamed in the new list. Here are some unsorted examples:

classify-document -> classify-document-by-type
configuration -> not present in new list
delete-configuration -> delete-configuration

then make a second list showing items from the new list that you couldn't find a correspondance to in the origional list

not present in original -> authentication



RESULTS

Renamed Items from the ORIGINAL LIST to the NEW LIST:

FRANCES: I went endpoint by endpoint and verified all the old ones are present and correctly redirect. so that's cool. but now I'd have to add subpaths to the them ugh, unless I wanted to just rename the files...
