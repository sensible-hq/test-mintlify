Welcome to Sensible! If you have any questions, please reach out by chat or [support@sensible.so](mailto:support@sensible.so) and we'd be happy to help you out. 

To get started, see the following endpoints. Or, see the [Sensible SDK quickstarts](/integrations/sdk-guides).

| Document extraction (asynchronous)  | <br/>\- [Extract doc at a Sensible URL](/api-reference/extraction/document/generate-upload-url) <br/>\- [Extract doc at your URL](/api-reference/extraction/document/extract-from-url)                                  | Takes a document file, such as a PDF, and returns extracted data asynchronously. Use the asynchronous endpoints in production. You have two options for asynchronously extracting from your document: <br/>\- extract a doc at a URL you provide<br/>\- upload and extract the doc at a Sensible URL. You can then call the [Retrieve extraction](/api-reference/extraction/retrieve-extractions/retrieving-results) endpoint to get the results, or specify a webhook for Sensible to push the results to as soon as they're ready. |
| Document extraction (synchronous)   | [Extract data from a document](/api-reference/extraction/document/extract-data-from-a-document)                                                                                       | Returns extracted document data synchronously. Use this endpoint for testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
