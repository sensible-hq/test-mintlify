A _line_ is a rectangular region containing text. Sensible represents lines as gray boxes. Lines can occupy the same height on the page:

 In other words, Sensible separates lines using any whitespace, not just newlines.

### Line sorting

Sensible sorts lines primarily by their height on the page (their y-axis position) and secondarily by their left-to-right position (their x-axis position).

For example, this image shows which lines precede and succeed a target line:

When text such as handwriting is slightly misaligned vertically, line sorting is less intuitive. In the following image, a human reader may interpret the red line as succeeding the target line, but for Sensible it _precedes_ the target line because it's higher on the page:

To configure this default sorting behavior, see [the Sort Lines parameter](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/senseml-reference/field-query-object/method-object).

### Line grouping

**Label method**

For the Label method, Sensible groups lines together using whitespace and x- and y-axis positions. Sometimes, Sensible's line groups are more restrictive than a human reader might expect. In particular, Sensible groups lines separated by vertical space solely if they align at the _left_ edge of each line boundary by default:

To capture unaligned lines, use the [Document Range](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/senseml-reference/methods/document-range) method.
