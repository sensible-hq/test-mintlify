title: "List tips"
---

This Sensible Instruct method extracts repeating data in a document based on your description of the listâ€™s overall contents and each individual item. Data such as the work history or skills on a resume, the vehicles on an auto insurance policy, or the line items on an invoice are best suited for this method. 

This method is an alternative to the [NLP Table](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/llm-based-extractions/prompt-tips/nlp-table-extraction-tips) method, when the data you want can appear either as a table or as another layout. The List method can find data in paragraphs of free text or in more structured layouts, such as key/value pairs or tables. 

#### Prompt tips

* The list description describes the overall contents for the list, while each property is a single description of an item that repeats in the list.
* You can use location hints to describe the target list's position in the document. For examples of location hints, see [Query Group](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/llm-based-extractions/prompt-tips/query-group-extraction-tips) extraction tips.
* For more information about how to write descriptions, or "prompts", see [Query Group](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/llm-based-extractions/prompt-tips/query-group-extraction-tips) extraction tips.
* For advanced options, see [Advanced prompt configuration](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/llm-based-extractions/advanced-prompt-configuration).

#### Troubleshooting

* If Sensible partially extracts a multi-page list, for example skipping pages in the list, use a different LLM engine. For more information, see the [LLM Engine parameter](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/senseml-reference/llm-based-methods/list#parameters).

## Examples

### Example 1

The following example shows using the List method to extract data from a restaurant menu:

To try out this example in the Sensible app, take the following steps: 

1. Download the following example document:  
| Example document | [Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensible-hq/sensible-docs/main/readme-sync/assets/v0/pdfs/list.pdf) |  

2. Create a test document type in the Sensible app, then click the document type you created to edit it. In the document type's **Reference documents** tab, upload the example document you downloaded in a previous step.
3. Click the document type's **Configurations** tab, create a new test configuration, and click the configuration you created to edit it.
4. Click **Sensible Instruct** and create fields to extract data using the following table:

| Field name | Method | Overall list description                                                | Property ids and descriptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
