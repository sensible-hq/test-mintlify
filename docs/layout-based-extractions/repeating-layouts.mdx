title: "Repeating layouts"
---

To extract complex, repeating data from documents, use layout-based sections to break the document into subdocuments. Then extract data from each subdocument with layout- or LLM-based fields. Note that for simpler repeating data, you can use the [List](https://sensible-87.mintlify.app/senseml-reference/llm-based-methods/list) method.

The following images show using sections to enable extracting repeating data in a claims loss run and in a complex table.
